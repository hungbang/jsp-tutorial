            <p><strong>PageContext</strong></p>

<p><strong></strong></p><strong>

</strong><p><strong></strong><br></p><p><strong>&gt;&gt; Please define clearly what pageContext is and what it does.</strong></p>

<p>A PageContext instance provides access to all the namespaces associated with a JSP page, provides access to several page attributes, as well as a layer above the implementation details. Implicit objects are added to the pageContext automatically.</p>



<p>The PageContext provides a number of facilities to the developer, including:</p>



<p>- a single API to manage the various scoped namespaces<br>- a number of convenience API's to access various public objects<br>- a mechanism to obtain the JspWriter for output<br>- a mechanism to manage session usage by the page<br>- a mechanism to expose page directive attributes to the scripting environment<br>- mechanisms to forward or include the current request to other active components in the application<br>- a mechanism to handle errorpage exception processing </p>



<p><strong>&gt;&gt; And how is pageContext.setAttribute("name", value) different from session.setAttribute("name", value).</strong></p>



<p>PageContext has a set of attributes that are different from the Session object.</p>



<p>The attributes set on PageContext are only available for a given page. The attributes are not available to other pages or servlets in the application.</p>



<p>Session attributes are created per each user's session. The session attributes are unique to a given session id. Session attributes are available to other pages and servlets in the application for a given session id.</p>



<p><strong>&gt;&gt; Your session ID is: ${pageContext.session.id}, why do this if we could get the session ID doing this: session.getId(). </strong></p>



<p>As stated above, PageContext has a handle to the session object. You can access the session object via the pageContext or you can access the session object directly. Two different mechanisms for accessing the same object.</p>



<p><strong>&gt;&gt; Please also include how it's instantiated and where it comes from besides its purpose.</strong></p>



<p>The PageContext is implicitly instantiated by the application server.</p>



<p>The JSP page will always have access to the PageContext.</p>

<p>====<br></p><p>The following information is from student Jose M. (thanks!)<br></p>

<p><strong>Session Object</strong></p>

<p><em>By default, JSPs have session tracking enabled and a new HttpSession 
object is instantiated for each new client automatically. Disabling 
session tracking requires explicitly turning it off by setting the page 
directive session attribute to false as follows:</em></p>

<p><em></em></p><em>

</em><p><em></em><br></p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">&lt;em&gt;&lt;%@ page session="false" %&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;</pre>



<p><em></em></p><em>





</em><p><em></em><br></p><p><em>The JSP engine exposes the HttpSession object to the JSP author through the implicit <strong>session</strong> object. Since <strong>session</strong> object
 is already provided to the JSP programmer, the programmer can 
immediately begin storing and retrieving data from the object without 
any initialization or getSession().</em></p>

<p><em></em></p><em>



</em><p><em></em><br></p><p><em>Just though it may 
be useful to somebody that keeps wondering where the session object 
comes from. <br></em></p>

<p><em></em></p>

<p>===</p><p><strong>Question

</strong></p>







<p>When does the object we store in the session get updated? How does it work behind the scenes?</p>















<p><strong>Answer</strong></p>











<p>When you use the statement:</p>













<p><code>List&lt;String&gt; items = (List&lt;String&gt;) session.getAttribute("myToDoList"); </code> </p>













<p>The "items" variable is pointing to the SAME object in the session. 
You don't get a local copy. You are pointing to the same object.</p>













<p>Any changes to the "items" variable such as calling "items.add(...)" 
performs the update on the session object since we are pointing to the 
same object.</p>













<p>As a result, there is no need to explicitly update the session object.</p>













<p>You are not required to use the code below</p>













<p><code>session.setAttribute("myToDoList", items); </code> </p>





















<p>---</p>













<p>The key here is that we are pointing to the same object in the session.</p>













<p>Happy coding!</p>
